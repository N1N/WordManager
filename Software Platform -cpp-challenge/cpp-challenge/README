# Buggy

The application 'buggy' performs the following functions: 

1. It reads a list of ASCII words from STDIN, a word per input line, terminated by the word 'end'.
2. It removes the duplicates, sorts the words alphabetically, and prints them with the number of how many times each word was encountered.
3. Then it repeatedly asks the user to enter a word and tries to look it up in the word list which was entered initially. It terminates when it encounters EOF.

## Build

Build the buggy application in a linux machine using below command,

```
g++ -std=c++11 buggy.cxx -o buggy -lpthread
```

## Execution

Execute the buggy application using the below command in a linux machine,
```
./buggy
```

## Assumptions

* If the user provides multiple inputs (spaces between them), only the first word need to be considered.
* If the user presses 'Enter' before entering a word, it must be ignored.
* There is not limit to the input word length.
